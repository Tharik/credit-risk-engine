# 🚀 Credit Risk Engine

A configurable, enterprise-grade REST API for customer credit risk classification, personalized credit limit calculation, and monthly income estimation.

Designed as a modular monolith using Clean Architecture principles, this solution emphasizes:

* **Data-driven business rules**
* **Maintainability and extensibility**
* **Deterministic policy enforcement**
* **Comprehensive automated testing**
* **Production-minded containerization and CI/CD**

---

# 📌 Overview

This application classifies customers into predefined credit clusters based on:

* Credit score
* Age
* Market debt profile
* Job title

It then:

* Assigns a job category
* Calculates estimated monthly income
* Computes approved credit limit
* Applies penalty rules
* Enforces cluster caps

All classification and financial rules are externally configurable through JSON configuration rather than hardcoded logic.

# ⚙️ Design Decisions

## Why modular monolith?

A modular monolith was intentionally chosen to:

* Avoid unnecessary distributed complexity
* Enforce architectural boundaries
* Maximize maintainability
* Improve testability
* Keep operational overhead low

---

## Why configuration-driven rules?

Business policies are expected to evolve.

Externalizing rules into configuration:

* Decouples policy from deployment
* Improves governance
* Reduces code churn
* Enables future operational flexibility

---

## Why non-root Docker runtime?

Running containers as non-root:

* Reduces security risk
* Aligns with production best practices
* Demonstrates security awareness

---

# 📊 Rule Engine

Rules are loaded from:

```txt
src/CreditRiskEngine.Api/rules.json
```

Configured categories:

* Clusters
* Job categories
* Penalties

This allows policy updates without core logic rewrites.

---

# 🧪 Testing Strategy

## Unit Tests

Coverage includes:

* Cluster assignment boundaries
* Job title keyword matching
* Case-insensitive matching
* Priority ordering
* Credit formula correctness
* Penalty rules
* Cap enforcement
* Monthly income matrix
* CLUSTER_D denial logic

---

## Integration Tests

Coverage includes:

* Full POST `/customers/classify` request/response cycle
* Invalid score handling
* Missing required fields
* HTTP 400 validation responses

---

## Run Tests

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --logger "trx" --results-directory TestResults
```

---

# 🐳 Docker

## Build

```bash
docker build -t credit-risk-engine .
```

## Run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Swagger

```txt
http://localhost:8080/swagger
```
Interactive API documentation is automatically available via Swagger UI when the application is running.

---

# 🔄 CI/CD

GitHub Actions pipeline includes:

* Dependency restore
* Full build validation
* Unit and integration test execution
* Published test reports with pass/fail visibility
* Docker image build verification

Detailed test reports are automatically published within GitHub Actions for improved validation visibility.

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Potential next steps:

* Rule versioning
* Admin configuration UI
* Database-backed policy management
* Audit trails
* Observability dashboards
* Feature flags for policy rollout
* Multi-region policy segmentation

---

# 🛡️ Security Considerations

* Stateless architecture
* Input validation
* Controlled configuration loading
* Non-root containerization
* Deterministic rule evaluation
* Global exception handling to avoid leaking internal stack traces in API responses

---

# 📍 Final Notes

This project was intentionally designed to balance:

* Enterprise readiness
* Architectural clarity
* Practical simplicity
* Scalability
* Maintainability

It is not merely a coding exercise implementation, but rather a production-minded credit policy engine prototype.
